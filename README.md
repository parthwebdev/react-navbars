## Getting Started

### Getting started is as simple as cloning the repository

```

### Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

### Project Structure

The navbar components are located inside the `src/components` directory. Each navbar has its own folder (e.g. navbar-01, navbar-02) containing the React component file and an `index.css`. Import the component into the `App.tsx` and import the corresponding `index.css` into `main.tsx` to apply the styles.
